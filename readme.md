# JustStreamIt



## Description:
It's a web application to view top rated movies filtred by imdb scores in real time.
We used a local API that called OCMovies-API that you can find on the following code repository  : https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR
The goal is to retrieve movies' data from this API using ajax requests and display them on a web interface.

## Implementation:
This version works with a local API, you should clone the repository https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR and then follow their instructions to run it with

```sh
python manage.py runserver
````
